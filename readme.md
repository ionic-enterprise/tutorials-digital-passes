# Digital Passes

This repository contains information about developing Digital Passes that can be used with Apple Wallet and Google Wallet.

The following folders are used:
- [**app**](./app/readme.md) - This contains a Capacitor application that adds an Apple Wallet Pass or Google Wallet Pass.
- [**backend**](./backend/readme.md) - This contains a Cloudflare Worker backend (NodeJS) that creates the digital pass.

# Apple Wallet Passes

Digital passes for Apple Wallet comes in the form of a file format called `pkpass`. 

These can be created, sent as email attachments, downloaded as files or linked in websites. They are generated by your backend server. See [the backend docs](./backend/readme.md) for more information on how to create passes.

# Google Wallet Passes

## Adding to Google Wallet

Google Wallet has prerequisites for a Google Wallet API issuer account and GCP account (see [documentation](https://developers.google.com/wallet/generic/web/prerequisites)).

In your backend you will [authenticate and authorize](https://developers.google.com/wallet/generic/web) and [create a pass object](https://developers.google.com/wallet/generic/web#creating_a_passes_object).

In your application you can [add a pass to Google Wallet](https://developers.google.com/wallet/generic/web#saving_to) which will generate a JWT token which can then be used in a "Add to Google Wallet" link which is in the format:
`https://pay.google.com/gp/v/save/{token}`
